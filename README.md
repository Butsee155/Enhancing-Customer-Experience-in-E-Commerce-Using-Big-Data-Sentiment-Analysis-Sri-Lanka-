The swift growth of e-commerce in Sri Lanka has heightened rivalry among online retailers, 
making the customer experience a crucial factor for achieving success. This study examines how 
big data sentiment analysis contributes to improving customer experience in the e-commerce 
industry of Sri Lanka. Using sentiment analysis methods on customer feedback, companies can 
obtain important insights into consumer preferences, satisfaction rates, and engagement trends. 
The research intends to assess the influence of sentiment-based insights on customer satisfaction, 
buying behavior, and retention tactics.  
A quantitative research method was used, gathering survey answers from 63 e-commerce users in 
Sri Lanka. Data analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS, utilizing correlation and regression 
analyses to discover significant connections between sentiment scores and important customer 
experience metrics. The results demonstrate a significant relationship between sentiment analysis 
and customer satisfaction, with insights derived from sentiment being essential in shaping 
engagement levels and retention rates. The regression models indicate that positive sentiment 
greatly boosts satisfaction and raises the chances of repeat purchases and recommendations, 
whereas negative sentiment underscores aspects needing service enhancements.  
The research determines that large-scale data sentiment analysis is an effective means for 
enhancing e-commerce tactics, enabling companies to customize marketing initiatives, boost 
customer assistance, and enhance service excellence. By incorporating sentiment analysis into 
their decision-making strategies, Sri Lankan e-commerce platforms can enhance customer 
relationships and attain sustainable growth in a competitive online market. The study offers 
practical suggestions for e-commerce companies to adopt sentiment-based strategies, highlighting 
the necessity of monitoring sentiment in real-time and utilizing AI-driven tools for customer 
interaction.
